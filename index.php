                <p class="post_body">Among Van Gogh’s most intriguing Arles paintings is The Night Café (September 1888),
                     depicting the Café de la Gare, where he would drink in the evenings, 
                     often with his friend the postman Joseph Roulin. He also lodged there
                      from May to September 1888, in a small bedroom above the café.
